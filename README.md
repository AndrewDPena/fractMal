# FractMal
## An image tiling program

# About the Project
FractMal is a silly program written on a whim. The idea is to take an input image, and tile it in proportion to its pixels. For example, a 32 x 32 image becomes a 32<sup>2</sup2> x  32<sup>2</sup2>  image, creating a sort of collage wherein each "pixel" of the new image is a full copy of the original, and each "pixel" in the new image has a colored layer matching the color of the corresponding pixel in the original image.

This project works really well on still images, and decently well on gifs that don't have movement over transparent backgrounds. Unfortunately, the program does not currently work really well on gifs with movement over transparent backgrounds, because of how the gif format works. This is a work in (maybe) progress.
